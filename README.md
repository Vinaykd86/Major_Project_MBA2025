# Technical Analysis of Bank nifty from July2024 to April2025
This project is a comprehensive technical analysis of the Bank Nifty index, undertaken as part of the final dissertation for the Master of Business Administration (MBA) program at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, Delhi. Spanning approximately 165 trading days between July 2024 and April 2025, this study focuses on identifying market trends, reversal signals, and potential swing trading opportunities using well-established technical tools and multi-timeframe chart analysis. The research was conducted under the guidance of Dr. Sukhvinder Singh, Assistant Professor, and leverages real-time market data from platforms like TradingView and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

The primary objective of the project is to interpret trading signals, enhance understanding of technical analysis for decision making and develop disciplined trading strategies based on historical price movements, focusing specifically on the Bank Nifty index — a crucial sectoral benchmark that reflects the performance of India’s most liquid and capitalized banking stocks. Through the use of Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands, Simple and Exponential Moving Averages (SMA & EMA), Fibonacci retracement levels, and candlestick patterns, this analysis aims to uncover potential market turning points and actionable trade setups. The research emphasizes a confluence-based approach, validating trading decisions only when multiple indicators align, thereby increasing signal reliability.

A multi-timeframe analysis was conducted, starting with the weekly chart to understand the long-term direction, followed by the daily and hourly charts to refine short-term entries and exits. Weekly analysis revealed that Bank Nifty remained in a long-term bullish structure with brief correction phases, validating Dow Theory’s principle of market cycles. Daily chart patterns such as falling wedges and bullish flags were used to identify breakout opportunities, while the 200 EMA provided dynamic support confirmation. Hourly analysis helped detect flag consolidations, pinpoint entry near swing lows, and define stop-loss and target levels using real-time volatility and momentum tools.

The study concludes that Bank Nifty was in a broadly bullish phase during the analysis period, and swing trades were best timed at pullbacks within the trend using candlestick confirmation at key support/resistance zones. The report also explores how Bank Nifty correlates with Nifty 50, enhancing directional confidence when both indices align. Although the study is purely technical in nature—excluding any macroeconomic or fundamental considerations—it provides a structured methodology for retail and institutional traders to navigate volatile markets more effectively.

This project stands on strong academic foundations, with a detailed literature review referencing works from global and Indian researchers including John Murphy, Andrew Lo, and Adrin Taran-Morosan, among others. It validates the predictive utility of traditional indicators when used with discipline and market context.

The scope of this analysis is focused and practical, aimed at improving decision-making for swing traders, particularly those trading index futures and options. It avoids algorithmic complexity and maintains clarity by relying solely on price action and technical indicators. The findings and methodology presented here serve as a useful guide for traders, researchers, and students who wish to understand and apply technical analysis in real-time financial markets.
